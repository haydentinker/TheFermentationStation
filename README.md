# The Fermentation Station

App that keeps track of your fermentation projects

# Motivation

Over the past year I have gotten into making things like kombucha, pickled vegetables, and hot sauce. The only problem was I kept forgetting when they would be ready or the fact they existed in my closet at all. With this app I hope to get an easy way to keep track of all my projects.
